This is a productivity tool which draws great inspiration from workflowy and vim.

Try it out!
- [online] (https://vimflowy.bitballoon.com)
- [local/dev](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimflowy/dkdhbejgjplkmbiglmjobppakgmiimei)
  *This will no longer be maintained, as [Chrome apps are getting essentially deprecated](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html).*

(Video coming eventually...)

## FEATURES ##

- Workflowy features

## NOTES ##

- The app is entirely local. The online version uses localStorage, so it should be used in only one browser.
  If you're going to have a large document, use a browser with large localStorage limits
- Currently, there is no simultaneous editing
- Tested mostly in Chrome and Firefox
- There are [known inconsistencies with vim](vim_inconsistencies.md)
- Contributions are very welcome!  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested
